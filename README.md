# About

Smarthome dashboard app assesment project.

# Notes

For the sake of simplicity, the app doesn't include any third-party libraries. However, in real-world scenarios, I would utilize a UI library to avoid inline styles and implement theme designs based on the current device configuration.

# Getting Started

to start a project run `yarn`

- for ios: run `cd ios && pod install`
